Run the following code and explain the output:

var sample = function(){
    var a = b = 3;
}
sample();
console.log("Is a defined?", typeof a !== "undefined");
console.log("Is b defined?", typeof b !== "undefined");


Write a function that takes in an input and returns true if it's an integer and false otherwise.

Ex:
Input: "7"
Output: false

Input: 7
Output: true

Input: 4.3
Output: false

Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and outputs the average of all the numbers.

Ex:
Input: [ 1 , 4 , 7 ]
Output: 4

Input: [ 10, 5 ]
Output: 7.5

Input: [ 1.5, 3, 2.5, 1 ]
Output: 2


Write a function that takes in a string and outputs the first occurrence of a character that does not repeat itself in that string.

Ex:
Input: "the quick brown fox jumps over the calm kitten quietly"
Output: "b"

Input: "this hat is the greatest!"
Output: "g"

Input: "what a wonderful day it has been!"
Output: "o"

Write a function that takes in a single word as a string and returns true if it's a palindrome and false otherwise (a palindrome is spelled the same way forwards and backwards).

Ex:
Input: "noon"
Output: true

Input: "horse"
Output: false

Input: "racecar"
Output: true

Write a function that takes in a string and outputs the number of vowels (not counting y).

Ex:
Input: "hello"
Output: 2

Input: "you are great!"
Output: 6

Input: "why?"
Output: 0

Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and outputs the maximum number.

Ex:
Input: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
Output: 3

Input: [ 3, 6, 4, 5, 2, 1 ]
Output: 6

Input: [ 3, 3, 3 ]
Output: 3

Write a function that takes in an integer and outputs the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that integer.

Ex:
Input: 2
Output: 3 (because 1 + 2 = 3)

Input: 4
Output: 10  (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)

Input: 10
Output: 55

Write a function that takes in two numbers and outputs the max (the greater of the two numbers).

Ex: 
Input: 1, 2
Output: 2

Input: 6, -4
Output: 6

Input: 3.4, 2
Output: 3.4
